## Introduction

![GraphicalAbstract](https://github.com/FranklinSierra/TFM-CRC-Diagnosis/assets/37815136/4563f1e2-07bf-4b8f-b2b9-b99abd80cd30)

This work introduces an end-to-end computational strategy that allows the enhancement of standard colonoscopy observations, by including vascular patterns, typically observed from NBI mechanisms. These retrieved synthetic images are achieved under a non-aligned translation task from optical colonoscopy (OC) to NBI including an architecture to achieve an automatic classification from enhanced colonoscopy observations.
